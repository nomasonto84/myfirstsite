      <p> Our purpose is to provide online mental health and wellness education.

Our hope is to spread awareness through advocacy of mental health by providing scientifically accurate and up-to-date coverage of mental health and illness topics. At MentalHelp.net, our intent is to educate, catalog and provide mental health information that compliments, but does not replace, the medical advice of personal medical professionals.

Our service is freely available and intended for both laypeople and professionals in need of mental help. We offer detailed and comprehensive coverage of mental health and illness articles (such as Addiction, Depression, ADHD, and Personality Disorders).

Ethics
Here at serene minds, we commit to high ethical standards in the interest of being as helpful as possible to those seeking treatment.

Our mental help content is impartial and unbiased. Serene minds does not endorse or subscribe to any particular recovery method, and we believe that the personal decision to seek treatment is one that should be done autonomously and with the support of all possible information.

We hold ourselves to the highest level of financial integrity, and we do not sell or broker admissions, or engage in unethical “consultant contracts.” If you encounter any marketing practices based on calls made to centers or helplines listed on this site that you feel are deceptive, unethical, or misleading, contact us and we will do our best to correct the situation and help you find a trustworthy provider.

Identifying an Appropriate Treatment Provider
The process of finding a treatment provider can feel overwhelming. Resources, like facility websites or serene minds and the following guide, can help you determine which options are best for you or your loved one.

Identify proper accreditation and licensure. Appropriate state licensure is important in determining what services and levels of care are permissible to be rendered at a treatment center. Some facilities voluntarily obtain accreditation from the Joint Commission or CARF, indicating that they have met quality and safety standards that go beyond those required by the state.
Determine if the program is a clinical match. Successful outcomes rely on appropriate clinical care. There is no one-size-fits-all method to treatment. When searching for treatment, ask an admissions counselor for details on the clinical program. Are the methodologies utilized evidence-based (meaning scientifically proven to produce better outcomes)? Does the treatment center employ medically licensed healthcare providers? Will the center provide the name and credentials of its providers? Has the treatment center published any outcome studies? Make note of the questions you are asked by the admissions team, and if they ask you for your medical history. This will help you and the facility’s staff determine if your needs match with the clinical program offered.
Assess your financial options. Discuss with your insurance provider or an admissions counselor if treatment is “in-network.” If your insurance provider will not cover treatment or a portion of treatment, determine what additional expenses you may have to cover ahead of time, and ask if payment plans are available.
Get as much information as possible. Read about the staff’s experiences, skills, and licenses online, and view videos and photos and read reviews to “see” what the treatment experience will be like. Ask an admissions counselor about how the intake, treatment, and discharge process work, and about what happens after treatment.
Look for red flags and possible warning signs. Some treatment centers advertise a “cure” or an unrealistic success rate. Others may only ask you about your ability to pay, and then determine a “fit” without getting any medical or clinical information about you. Some possible bad actors will even offer you gifts, cash incentives, help with obtaining insurance, or free travel. These are possible signs of illegal or unethical behaviors that can possibly harm you or your loved one.
